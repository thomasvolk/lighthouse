# LighthouseService

Web service for the [lighthouse](https://github.com/thomasvolk/lighthouse) application.

If you start more than one server in a LAN network, they will find each other automatically.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:9996`](http://localhost:9996) from your browser.
